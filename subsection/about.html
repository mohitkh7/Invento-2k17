						Invento, The Official Techfest of IET-DAVV, is the biggest in the Central India. We are the students of IET-DAVV who organizes this mega-event every year giving an opportunity to the all technical enthusiasts to show their talent. In addition to this, Techfest aims at reaching out to all the students and promoting the vision of Technology and Science among the students.

						Last year, it ended up as a huge success when it witnessed the footfall of over 18,000 students from all corners of the Central India. Here are some of the glimpses of what was a thrilling 3 day experience for the visitors and the participants.

						Along with Seminars on Trending Technology like 3D Printing, IC engines, WireLess Robotics, Ethical Hacking and Construction Project Management by technical giants Mozilla and Microsoft Group, there were numerous competitions like Roborace, Hackathon, Quiz-Grey Carnage, Assembling-Disassembling and many more. Major Workshops were organized on Android app development, IOT and Cloud Computing.
